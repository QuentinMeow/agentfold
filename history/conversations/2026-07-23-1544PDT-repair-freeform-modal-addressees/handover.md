# Handover — repair free-form modal addressees

**Session:** 2026-07-23 15:44–15:49 PDT, codex
**Task:** 2026-07-23-first-class-message-queue
**Mode:** async
**Queue projection:** v1

## What happened

- Closed adjacent provider-prose bypasses for modal requests addressed to ordinary
  named groups such as platform engineers, a security guild, or release managers.
- Replaced organizational-suffix enumeration with a bounded addressee grammar followed
  by a recognized action verb.
- Added the exact missed phrases plus negation and capability regressions.

## How it works now

A modal request may name a person or group in ordinary prose without relying on a fixed
list of role suffixes. The detector still requires a request-shaped modal followed by a
recognized action verb and excludes local negation and capability-only questions.

## Decisions made for you

None; this is a grammar repair within the accepted provider-neutral projection design.

## Needs your attention

- [Confirm the four claim ceilings below, or name a profile whose promise should change.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-assurance-profile-ceilings.md) — Why-you-might-care: Profile names must not advertise stronger protection than their actual enforcement boundary. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current proposal remains unchanged.
- [Confirm the separate failure state and its mode-dependent transition behavior, or describe the desired alternative.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-detector-failure-state.md) — Why-you-might-care: A crashed or incomplete scanner must not accidentally become evidence that content is safe. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the separate failure state remains a proposal.
- [After the PR is linked and status becomes waiting, review the queue-ownership invariant, timing prefixes, and enforcement before merge.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-first-class-message-queue.md) — Why-you-might-care: This changes every human and durable cross-session agent action surface in AgentFold. || If-you-do-nothing: The task may be reviewed and revised, but it does not merge.
- [Confirm that self-authored acknowledgements may record judgment but may never authorize a confirmed critical finding.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-guardrail-authority-boundary.md) — Why-you-might-care: Treating an agent-authored receipt as approval would let the producing agent waive its own security gate. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current authority split remains a proposal.
- [Confirm the incident-recovery boundary and sequence, or identify a missing recovery obligation.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-sensitive-data-recovery.md) — Why-you-might-care: Deleting one Git file does not undo credential or private-data disclosure across remote copies and logs. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current recovery sequence remains a proposal.
- [Review whether the expanded explanation makes the existing template-first decision understandable; request wording changes if it does not.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-template-first-explanation.md) — Why-you-might-care: This review is about whether the documentation now explains a prior decision, not whether an implementation task may reverse it. || If-you-do-nothing: AgentFold continues to ship mechanisms as opt-in templates under the decided four-mode policy.

## Dead ends

Enumerating organizational suffixes closed one reported phrase but missed adjacent
ordinary group names.

## Next steps

None.
