# Handover — review-receipt normalization repairs

**Session:** 2026-08-04 05:04–05:34 PDT, codex sol-high implementer
**Task:** 2026-08-04-stop-review-verdicts-from-looking-like-human-asks
**Mode:** async
**Queue projection:** v1

## What happened

- Nothing is blocked; all three valid blockers from the 0-approve/3-block panel on `e073358` are repaired locally.
- Only ASCII space and tab lines are blank receipt separators; hostile Unicode whitespace, controls, invisible characters, HTML, comments, and code close the block.
- LF, CR, and CRLF line bodies are explicit, with a valid CRLF receipt covered end to end.
- Claimants and reviewers now use the same rendered-human identity and placeholder grammar; every requested verification lane is green.

## How it works now

Receipt contiguity is a byte-shaped rule rather than Python whitespace semantics. Reviewer authority is a rendered-human comparison: visible HTML text counts, default-ignorables do not split names, markup-only and placeholder identities are empty, and only a real identity distinct from one real claimant can neutralize a verdict token.

## Decisions made for you

- None. This session implemented the panel's blockers without changing the owner-authorized closed receipt structure.

## Needs your attention

- [Confirm that self-authored acknowledgements may record judgment but may never authorize a confirmed critical finding.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-guardrail-authority-boundary.md) — Why this matters: Treating an agent-authored receipt as approval would let the producing agent waive its own security gate. — If you do nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current authority split remains a proposal.
- [Confirm the revised design makes guard configuration, derived assurance, manual evidence, coverage limits, and controlled-egress non-scope clear.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-revised-assurance-profile-scope-and-egress.md) — Why this matters: The implementation must configure real guards and report only observed protection, rather than letting an agent select or claim an assurance label. — If you do nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the approved conceptual direction remains recorded but the revised design is not accepted.
- [Confirm the incident-recovery boundary and sequence, or identify a missing recovery obligation.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-sensitive-data-recovery.md) — Why this matters: Deleting one Git file does not undo credential or private-data disclosure across remote copies and logs. — If you do nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current recovery sequence remains a proposal.
- [Choose which of three shapes the rule for externally changed instruction files takes: holding the adopting work, holding nothing, or holding the merge itself.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/decisions/non-blocking-choose-the-gate-for-externally-changed-instruction-files.md) — Why this matters: Anyone who can open a pull request here can edit the files that direct every agent, and the rule meant to catch that promises a hold this repository can no longer apply. — If you do nothing: Nothing stops. The rule keeps promising a hold no file can express, so an outside edit to an instruction file is reviewed only if the agent that happens to see it decides to ask.
- [choose Option A or Option B, or state another choice](../../../message-queue/needs-human/decisions/non-blocking-correct-or-keep-the-auto-filed-retry-loop-in-a-principle.md) — Why this matters: A principle is the most-quoted kind of file here, and this one currently promises an automatic repair loop that no hook, CI job, or script actually starts. — If you do nothing: Nothing stops. The principle keeps describing the loop in the present tense until either you answer this or the filed retry-automation task ships and makes the sentence true.
- [Choose option A, B, or C for all three stranded merge reviews, or state another disposition.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/decisions/non-blocking-dispose-merge-reviews-whose-boundary-already-passed.md) — Why this matters: Three core changes are live on main today without the review each of them declared mandatory before merge, and no commit can now satisfy that gate. — If you do nothing: The reviews stay live and answerable, their tasks complete without them, and the crossing stays visible in Git history.
- [Choose whether the nine older waiting questions are left as written, replaced with plainer versions, or replaced only where their wording is now stale.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/decisions/non-blocking-re-ask-the-older-questions-in-plainer-words.md) — Why this matters: Nine of the questions in your queue were written in a format that buries the choice under bookkeeping, and four of them still ask about a moment that has already passed. — If you do nothing: They stay exactly as written and stay answerable; only questions filed from now on use the readable shape.
- [Choose whether an agent corrects the stale numbers in two principle files now, leaves them alone, or gets a standing permission to correct facts of this kind without asking.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/decisions/non-blocking-stop-a-principle-from-copying-the-line-budget.md) — Why this matters: The nine principle files are the most-quoted documents here, and one of them tells agents a size limit smaller than the real one, so an agent will cut a contract that was never too long. — If you do nothing: Nothing stops. The two files keep quoting numbers that are no longer true, and every agent that reads them inherits the wrong ones.
- [After the preceding PR has merged, this PR's base is stable, and this item becomes waiting, review the layered workspace design and read-only inspector, then approve the exact Git range, request a named change, or reject it before merge.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-layered-development-workspace.md) — Why this matters: This design shapes how public, private, restricted, raw, and temporary workspace content may eventually compose without pretending Git convenience mechanisms are confidentiality boundaries. — If you do nothing: The merged design and its inspector stand, and its task completes without your judgment on record.
- [Review whether the expanded explanation makes the existing template-first decision understandable; request wording changes if it does not.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-template-first-explanation.md) — Why this matters: This review is about whether the documentation now explains a prior decision, not whether an implementation task may reverse it. — If you do nothing: AgentFold continues to ship mechanisms as opt-in templates under the decided four-mode policy.
- [After the preceding PR has merged, this PR's base is stable, and this item becomes waiting, inspect the exact Git range and approve it, request a named change, or reject it before merge.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-test-runner-git-environment-isolation.md) — Why this matters: Every hook-launched repository test depends on this boundary not redirecting Git operations into the invoking checkout. — If you do nothing: The merged boundary stands as the repository-wide test boundary, and its task completes without your judgment on record.
- [Say whether this is the standard every human-facing message is held to, or name what to change.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-the-explanation-standard.md) — Why this matters: Every report, pull request, and question you get from an agent from now on is written to this standard, so a wrong rule here compounds across every future message. — If you do nothing: The standard stands as written and agents follow it; nothing stops, and it can be changed later by editing one file.
- [Say whether this pull-request shape works for you, or name the section to move, add, or drop.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-the-pull-request-shape.md) — Why this matters: This is the shape of every pull request you are asked to look at from now on, and it decides what you see before you have to click anything. — If you do nothing: The shape stands and every later pull request uses it; nothing stops, and changing it later means editing two files and one test.

## Dead ends

- Python's broad whitespace predicate and source-shaped identities were both too permissive for this security boundary; the panel on `e073358` rejected them.

## Next steps

- [After the GitHub issue is filed, keep it synchronized with the canonical task and close it only when the task's implementation is published or deliberately withdrawn.](../../../message-queue/needs-agent/requests/non-blocking-track-github-review-verdict-action-classification.md)
- [Triage GitHub issue #80 against its canonical task and retain this source binding until trusted provider evidence proves the issue closed.](../../../message-queue/needs-agent/requests/non-blocking-triage-github-issue-80-review-verdict-action-classification.md)
