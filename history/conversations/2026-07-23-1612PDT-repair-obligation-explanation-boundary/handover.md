# Handover — repair obligation and explanation boundary

**Session:** 2026-07-23 16:12–16:18 PDT, codex
**Task:** 2026-07-23-first-class-message-queue
**Mode:** async
**Queue projection:** v1

## What happened

- Closed an issue-prose bypass for hard lifecycle obligations addressed to groups whose
  names do not end in a known organizational suffix.
- Allowed a narrow self-answered explanatory question without weakening standalone
  questions, decisions, approval requirements, or directives.
- Added the exact reviewer cases and adjacent positive and negative regressions.

## How it works now

An unknown free-form subject is actionable only when a present hard obligation includes
both a recognized action and one of the lifecycle deadlines enforced by the projection
grammar. A short `how`, `what`, or `why` lead may be explanatory only when an immediate
non-action sentence answers it; the answer is still scanned for durable actions.

## Decisions made for you

None; this repairs the enforced boundary between queue-owned action and ordinary
explanation without changing the accepted queue design.

## Needs your attention

- [Confirm the four claim ceilings below, or name a profile whose promise should change.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-assurance-profile-ceilings.md) — Why-you-might-care: Profile names must not advertise stronger protection than their actual enforcement boundary. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current proposal remains unchanged.
- [Confirm the separate failure state and its mode-dependent transition behavior, or describe the desired alternative.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-detector-failure-state.md) — Why-you-might-care: A crashed or incomplete scanner must not accidentally become evidence that content is safe. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the separate failure state remains a proposal.
- [After the PR is linked and status becomes waiting, review the queue-ownership invariant, timing prefixes, and enforcement before merge.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-first-class-message-queue.md) — Why-you-might-care: This changes every human and durable cross-session agent action surface in AgentFold. || If-you-do-nothing: The task may be reviewed and revised, but it does not merge.
- [Confirm that self-authored acknowledgements may record judgment but may never authorize a confirmed critical finding.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-guardrail-authority-boundary.md) — Why-you-might-care: Treating an agent-authored receipt as approval would let the producing agent waive its own security gate. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current authority split remains a proposal.
- [Confirm the incident-recovery boundary and sequence, or identify a missing recovery obligation.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-sensitive-data-recovery.md) — Why-you-might-care: Deleting one Git file does not undo credential or private-data disclosure across remote copies and logs. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current recovery sequence remains a proposal.
- [Review whether the expanded explanation makes the existing template-first decision understandable; request wording changes if it does not.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-template-first-explanation.md) — Why-you-might-care: This review is about whether the documentation now explains a prior decision, not whether an implementation task may reverse it. || If-you-do-nothing: AgentFold continues to ship mechanisms as opt-in templates under the decided four-mode policy.

## Dead ends

Treating every question mark as a durable action rejected self-contained explanation;
treating every free-form subject plus `should` as an action captured ordinary design
language.

## Next steps

None.
