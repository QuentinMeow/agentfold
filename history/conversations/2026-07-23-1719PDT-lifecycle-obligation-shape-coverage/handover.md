# Handover — lifecycle-obligation shape coverage

**Session:** 2026-07-23 17:19–17:25 PDT, codex
**Task:** 2026-07-23-first-class-message-queue
**Mode:** async
**Queue projection:** v1

## What happened

- Removed the action-verb-shape dependency from the high-confidence lifecycle
  obligation fallback.
- Covered passive approval, gerund fixing, soft passive requirements, approval nouns,
  and `needs a fix` phrasing.
- Preserved negative, capability, property, historical, and reported-speech controls.

## How it works now

A present obligation tied to a named lifecycle deadline is actionable regardless of
whether its work appears as an active verb, passive participle, gerund, or noun. The
fallback still requires current obligation and lifecycle evidence and excludes forms
that only describe capability, a property, history, or reported speech.

## Decisions made for you

None; this replaces brittle lexical coverage with the existing semantic evidence.

## Needs your attention

- [Confirm the four claim ceilings below, or name a profile whose promise should change.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-assurance-profile-ceilings.md) — Why-you-might-care: Profile names must not advertise stronger protection than their actual enforcement boundary. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current proposal remains unchanged.
- [Confirm the separate failure state and its mode-dependent transition behavior, or describe the desired alternative.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-detector-failure-state.md) — Why-you-might-care: A crashed or incomplete scanner must not accidentally become evidence that content is safe. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the separate failure state remains a proposal.
- [After the PR is linked and status becomes waiting, review the queue-ownership invariant, timing prefixes, and enforcement before merge.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-first-class-message-queue.md) — Why-you-might-care: This changes every human and durable cross-session agent action surface in AgentFold. || If-you-do-nothing: The task may be reviewed and revised, but it does not merge.
- [Confirm that self-authored acknowledgements may record judgment but may never authorize a confirmed critical finding.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-guardrail-authority-boundary.md) — Why-you-might-care: Treating an agent-authored receipt as approval would let the producing agent waive its own security gate. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current authority split remains a proposal.
- [Confirm the incident-recovery boundary and sequence, or identify a missing recovery obligation.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/future-blocking-review-sensitive-data-recovery.md) — Why-you-might-care: Deleting one Git file does not undo credential or private-data disclosure across remote copies and logs. || If-you-do-nothing: Guardrail implementation waits at its start boundary; the current recovery sequence remains a proposal.
- [Review whether the expanded explanation makes the existing template-first decision understandable; request wording changes if it does not.](../../../message-queue/needs-human/reviews/non-blocking-review-template-first-explanation.md) — Why-you-might-care: This review is about whether the documentation now explains a prior decision, not whether an implementation task may reverse it. || If-you-do-nothing: AgentFold continues to ship mechanisms as opt-in templates under the decided four-mode policy.

## Dead ends

Adding one passive participle at a time left equivalent obligation shapes outside the
classifier. An optional `to` branch also backtracked around a capability exclusion.

## Next steps

None.
