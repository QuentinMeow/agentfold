# Worklog — Make the message queue the first-class interaction surface

## 2026-07-23 — first-class-message-queue (codex)

- Verified from GitHub and Git ancestry that merged PRs #4 and #6, including their final
  heads, are present on the fast-forwarded local `main`.
- Began three independent read-only audits: historical review-question intent, queue
  schema/naming blast radius, and every path that can create an unqueued human action.
- Found the first concrete gap: the original queue item requested only a generic
  acknowledgement, while later PR-only questions introduced new judgments without the
  choice explanations, examples, or canonical queue links required by the decision guide.
- Transcribed the owner's answers into three queue items, claimed them before folding,
  and pushed those coordination commits directly to `main`.
- Completed independent audits of the historical agent reasoning, live-action surfaces,
  and naming/check blast radius. The “blocking claims” question was an agent-owned
  consistency audit; the other jargon-heavy prompt was at least three separate reviews.
- Chose queue-owned actions with actor/kind/timing encoded independently, recorded the
  superseding ADR, and split the unanswered guardrail judgments into five context-rich
  future-blocking review items. A sixth item owns review of this queue-contract change.
- Folded the confirmed universal four-mode semantics into the guardrail design and
  deleted the three resolved queue projections.
