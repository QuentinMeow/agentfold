# Worklog — Make the message queue the first-class interaction surface

## 2026-07-23 — first-class-message-queue (codex)

- Verified from GitHub and Git ancestry that merged PRs #4 and #6, including their final
  heads, are present on the fast-forwarded local `main`.
- Began three independent read-only audits: historical review-question intent, queue
  schema/naming blast radius, and every path that can create an unqueued human action.
- Found the first concrete gap: the original queue item requested only a generic
  acknowledgement, while later PR-only questions introduced new judgments without the
  choice explanations, examples, or canonical queue links required by the decision guide.
