# Worklog — Make the message queue the first-class interaction surface

## 2026-07-23 — first-class-message-queue (codex)

- Verified from GitHub and Git ancestry that merged PRs #4 and #6, including their final
  heads, are present on the fast-forwarded local `main`.
- Began three independent read-only audits: historical review-question intent, queue
  schema/naming blast radius, and every path that can create an unqueued human action.
- Found the first concrete gap: the original queue item requested only a generic
  acknowledgement, while later PR-only questions introduced new judgments without the
  choice explanations, examples, or canonical queue links required by the decision guide.
- Transcribed the owner's answers into three queue items, claimed them before folding,
  and pushed those coordination commits directly to `main`.
- Completed independent audits of the historical agent reasoning, live-action surfaces,
  and naming/check blast radius. The “blocking claims” question was an agent-owned
  consistency audit; the other jargon-heavy prompt was at least three separate reviews.
- Chose queue-owned actions with actor/kind/timing encoded independently, recorded the
  superseding ADR, and split the unanswered guardrail judgments into five context-rich
  future-blocking review items. A sixth item owns review of this queue-contract change.
- Folded the confirmed universal four-mode semantics into the guardrail design and
  deleted the three resolved queue projections.
- Updated root/leaf contracts, all queue schemas, task and handover schemas, the
  operating guides, four portable skills, and the personal GitHub-summary skills.
  GitHub-specific action projection remains outside AgentFold core.
- Added mechanical checks for routed/prefixed queue files, class contradictions,
  zero-context human explanations, live task links, exact blocked-task reciprocity,
  dependency-aware staleness, and versioned handover projections. Generated retries
  preserve claimed/annotated state and only garbage-collect reconciler-owned files.
- Added 21 focused queue/handover tests. An independent automation review found seven
  first-pass gaps (including retry clobbering, rogue endpoints, and date-boundary
  behavior); all were repaired before the implementation commit.
- Audited 36 stop/reject claim units in the guardrail design. All 17 normative
  transition-stopping claims were correctly scoped to `hard`, a profile requiring hard
  controls, or provider authority; four excerpt-level ambiguities were clarified.
- A five-lens adversarial review began with three independent blockers. It found
  provider-date coupling, strict endpoint lock-in, hidden Markdown evidence, invalid
  date crashes, ambiguous task boundaries, retry collisions/staleness, an unqueued
  backlog action surface, a contradictory deletion ADR, premature reviewability, and
  unenforced future start boundaries.
- Reworked the implementation around a shared CommonMark semantic parser,
  repository-local handover adoption, extensible typed leaves, exact scoped transition
  tokens, reciprocal backlog pickup requests, artifact-gated reviews, and managed retry
  projections. Every reproduced failure now has a regression test.
- Confirmed the exact heads and merge commits of PRs #4 and #6 are ancestors of `main`;
  moved the completed core-portability task from review to done.
- A second hostile audit found ambiguous pickup inference, incomplete handover
  projection, symlink-backed evidence, mutable review targets, non-task branch failure,
  and several missing regression canaries. Pickup identity is now explicit; reviews
  bind to exact bytes/object ids; new handovers match the complete live human queue;
  queue/context evidence must be regular repository files.
- Added regressions for inline/escaped/indented/fenced Markdown disguises, invalid and
  oversized paths, broken symlinks, immediate transition blockers, non-task branches,
  legitimate active-task follow-ups, response revision binding, and exact new-handover
  projection. The full repository test runner passed 4/4 files (55 core-scope tests
  with one skip, 50 queue tests, 5 quote-api tests, and 3 quote-cli tests).

## 2026-07-24 — stacked-publication-coordination (codex)

- Reconstructed the task's in-review status and continuation action directly on the
  live coordination lane without copying reviewed-system code to `main`.
- Kept the merge review artifact-pending because the final coordination base is not
  authorized or published yet. A later queue-only edge will bind the exact range after
  the approved base is incorporated into PR #7.
- Preserved both rejected local coordination histories for audit; neither was pushed.
